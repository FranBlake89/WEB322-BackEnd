## Problem Description:


Using NodeJS, create a standalone console-based Javascript program that lets the user reserve a car rental.
The user must be able to enter the type of vehicle, number of days of the rental, and whether they want a
child seat in the car. Based on this user input, the program should search for an available vehicle. If a
vehicle is available, then calculate and output a receipt for the rental.
